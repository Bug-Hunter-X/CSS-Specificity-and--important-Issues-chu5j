The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected results when trying to override styles.  For example, if you have an inline style that conflicts with an internal stylesheet rule, and the internal rule conflicts with an external stylesheet rule, determining which style will ultimately be applied can be complicated and prone to errors.  Another common issue is the use of !important, which while it allows you to override any other style, makes CSS harder to maintain and debug in the long run because it violates the normal cascading rules.
